# GE-44ton-Locomotve
A 1.6" scale, 7.5" gauge GE 44 ton locomotive for the Live Steam hobby

This is a Solidworks project for a 1.6 scale 7.5" gauge electric locomotive that is a scale model of a GE 44 ton locomotive.
The project files are Solidworks. The Experimental Aircraft Association offers a student edition of Solidworks to its membership which itself 
costs around $40 a year. Feel free to fork your own version and convert it to Fusion360 if that is what you like. 
Project includes reference photos found across the internet.
